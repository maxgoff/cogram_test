# The Cogram Test
This repo contains the notebook and configuration files for the experiment I documented in my blog entry [CODE EX MACHINA](https://www.bigsmartdata.com/code-ex-machina/).

Code generation and augmentation by machine is becoming one of the more intresting use cases emerging
from the realm of NLP.  This experiment attempts to duplicate (by machine) the coding results or outcomes that technical interviews often probe for in potential software engineers.

All of the code snippets in the notebook were generated by the Cogram Jupyter Notebook extension.
